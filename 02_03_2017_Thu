HIGHLIGHTS :

Today was a normal day at Tesco. No Asha at Office
Ram - Steria Guy for ReIM team was taken out for lunch to Galito's, Akshay missed it(deliberately) - into colleage's app team
Spend almost entire day on getting webtop.war to run on eclipse, to disabling JSPTagPooling
Got old HP-Mini laptop to connect to internet and get access to it via ssh, Creating new users in Ubuntu

Technical Learnings:
1. When you get errors in tld's and other jsp's - Better to disable "Validations" in Eclipse preferences
2. If SSH is not enabled in a system :
    sudo apt-get install openssh-server
    /etc/init.d/ssh start
3. Programming generic "swap" function in C
4. Programming generic "lsearch" function in C
5. How to disable JspTagPooling in apache tomcat :
    Go to %CATALINA_HOME%/conf/web.xml file
    Search for "JSP" tag with a pre-existing tag call <fork> in it
    put another tag elements : <init-param><param-name>enablePooling</param-name><param-value>false</param-value></init-param>
6. The cache of JSP pages are always stored in the "work" directory in Apache Tomcat - CATALINA_HOME directory
7. Resolved myself to start Jounaling of my learnings from today onwards

  VIM-Casts :
    Too tired
  Interview Questions :
    

Professional/Behavioral Learnings :
1. Make sure you don't sell out your ideas/solutions free of cost. That will cost you more than what you tried to save for others
2. While you voice out - it is important that you get enough respect for what you are trying to say, otherwise people will neglect you

Summary :

A pretty day with moderate learnings and no bat habits performed.
