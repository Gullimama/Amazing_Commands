FOR %i IN (*.jar) DO mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=webtopJars -DartifactId=%~ni -Dpackaging=jar -Dversion=6.8 -Dfile=%i

above command is just amazing, for all .jar files in the directory, installes the jar into webtopJars groupID with artifact ID as the name of the file
and jar as the extrension iwth version as 6.8

%~ni = filename without extension
